# odin-recipes
## Welcome to My Recipe Project!
Hello there! This is my Recipe Project, a part of my journey through The Odin Project's Foundations Course. I'm practicing my HTML skills by building a simple, yet informative, recipe website.

What's Inside?
Inside, you'll find a homepage linking to a few of my favorite recipes. It's a little rough around the edges right now (I'm focusing on HTML, not beauty... yet), but watch this space. I'll be sprucing it up with some CSS magic soon!

Behind the Scenes
You won't just find tasty recipes here. I'm also learning to use Git and GitHub. I've set up a public repo, odin-recipes, where you can see all my project files and the steps I took to create them. I'll be committing changes as I go, giving you a peek into my coding process.

Join Me!
Follow along as I create an index.html page, link it to individual recipe pages, and fill them up with delicious details. I'll even be making this project accessible from the web, so you can see the finished website live!

Exciting things are cooking! Stay tuned...
